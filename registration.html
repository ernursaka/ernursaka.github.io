				<h3>Interactive Registration Tool</h3>
				<p align="justify">In-situ hybridization images contain information about how genes control cell type identity, cell differentiation, 
				and cell-cell signaling. In order to get this information, analyzing in-situ hybridization images via valuable quarries, 
				comparisons and combining results with existing knowledge is necessary.
				</p>
				
				<p align="justify">In-situ hybridization images needs to be organized into common coordinate 
				system for correct analysis. Due to the high resolution and distortions contained within 
				the images, this can be a challenging. In our work, we use three different image
				registration methodologies to put a reference and in situ hybridization image into 
				common coordinate system.</p>
				
				
				<p align="justify">All registration methodologies we applied take a reference image and
				transform it to have the same geometry as an in-situ hybridization image. The first
				methodology is based on landmark image registration algorithms. It uses user defined
				corresponding landmark pairs on both images to estimate transformation equation.
				Estimation of the transformation equation is done by one of the six different algorithms.
				They are affine, linear conformal, projective, polynomial, piecewise linear and local
				weighted mean. Second methodology is improved version of the first one. Instead of
				using user defined landmarks, it automatically finds corresponding landmark pairs. First
				it detects corner points from both images via Harris-Stephens corner detector. Later, it
				matches points that are maximally correlated with each other. The rest of the technique is
				the same with the first one. The last technique is using mutual information to register two
				images. Unlike the others, it is an area based registration technique. It works on whole
				image intensity values to perform registration. It tries all the transformation equations in
				search space and finds the one which maximizes the mutual information between two
				images. Eventually, we put three methodologies together in one tool, visualize the results
				in a user friendly way and save them for future work.</p>
